This repository contains a bash script that converts regular text to leetspeak.

## Files

- `text2leetspeak.sh`: The main script that converts text to leetspeak

# Make the script executable
chmod +x text2leetspeak.sh

# Convert text from a file
./text2leetspeak.sh filename.txt

echo "Hello World" | ./text2leetspeak.sh
```

## Leetspeak Conversion

The script converts the following characters:
- a/A → 4
- e/E → 3
- i/I → 1
- o/O → 0
- t/T → 7
- s/S → 5
- l/L → 1
