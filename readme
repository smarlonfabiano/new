## What is Leetspeak?

Leetspeak (or "1337speak") is a type of Internet slang where various combinations of ASCII characters are used as substitutes for letters in the Latin alphabet. For example:
- 'a' becomes '4'
- 'e' becomes '3'
- 'i' becomes '1'
- 'o' becomes '0'
- 's' becomes '5'
- 't' becomes '7'
- 'l' becomes '1'

## Testing

A test script is included to verify the functionality:

```bash
chmod +x test_leetspeak.sh
./test_leetspeak.sh
```
