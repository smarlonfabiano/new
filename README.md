# Security Vulnerability Assessment Tools

This repository contains tools for assessing security vulnerabilities in codebases. The tools are designed to help identify common security issues and potential attack vectors in your code.

## Security Vulnerability Scanner

The `security_scan.sh` script is a comprehensive security vulnerability scanner that analyzes your codebase for common security issues. It uses pattern matching and static analysis techniques to identify potential vulnerabilities.

### Features

- Scans entire codebases or specific directories
- Detects 15 common security vulnerability types
- Provides detailed output with severity levels
- Includes recommendations for remediation

## Test Script

The `test_security_scan.sh` script creates test files with various security vulnerabilities and runs the security scanner against them. This helps validate that the scanner is working correctly and can detect the vulnerabilities it claims to.

## Vulnerabilities Detected

The security scanner checks for the following types of vulnerabilities:

1. **Hardcoded Credentials** - Passwords, API keys, and other secrets in source code
2. **SQL Injection** - Unparameterized SQL queries that could allow attackers to manipulate database operations
3. **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)** - Unescaped output that could allow attackers to inject malicious scripts
4. **Command Injection** - Unsanitized user input passed to system commands
5. **Insecure Deserialization** - Unsafe deserialization of untrusted data
6. **Insecure File Operations** - File operations that could lead to path traversal or unauthorized access
7. **Insecure Cryptography** - Use of weak or outdated cryptographic algorithms
8. **Insecure Direct Object References (IDOR)** - Direct references to internal objects without access control
9. **Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF)** - Forms without CSRF protection
10. **Security Misconfiguration** - Insecure default configurations or verbose error messages
11. **Sensitive Data Exposure** - Inadequate protection of sensitive information
12. **Broken Authentication** - Weak authentication mechanisms
13. **Prompt Injection** - Attempts to manipulate AI systems through malicious prompts
14. **Dependency Vulnerabilities** - Outdated or vulnerable dependencies
15. **Logging and Monitoring Issues** - Insufficient logging for security events

## Usage

### Running the Security Scanner

Make the script executable:

```bash
chmod +x security_scan.sh
```

Scan the current directory:

```bash
./security_scan.sh
```

Scan a specific directory:

```bash
./security_scan.sh /path/to/your/code
```

### Running the Test Script

Make the script executable:

```bash
chmod +x test_security_scan.sh
```

Run the test:

```bash
./test_security_scan.sh
```

This will create test files with vulnerabilities and run the scanner against them.

## Interpreting Results

The scanner output is color-coded by severity:
- **RED**: High severity issues that should be addressed immediately
- **YELLOW**: Medium severity issues that should be addressed soon
- **GREEN**: Low severity issues that should be reviewed

Each finding includes:
- The severity level
- The type of vulnerability
- The file and line where the potential vulnerability was found

## Limitations

- The scanner uses pattern matching, which may result in false positives
- Some vulnerabilities require context that static analysis cannot provide
- The scanner cannot detect logical vulnerabilities or business logic flaws
- Manual code review is still necessary for comprehensive security assessment

## Best Practices

1. Run the scanner regularly as part of your development process
2. Address high-severity findings first
3. Use the scanner as part of a broader security strategy
4. Combine with dynamic analysis and penetration testing
5. Keep the scanner updated with new vulnerability patterns
