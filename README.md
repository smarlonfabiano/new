# Preloaded Instructions Handler

A Python module for safely handling preloaded instructions or initialization context in applications.

## Overview

This project provides utilities to validate, sanitize, and process preloaded data to prevent security issues like injection attacks. It demonstrates best practices for handling potentially untrusted input that might be used to initialize or configure an application.

## Features

- Validation of instruction format and content
- Detection of common injection patterns
- Sanitization of potentially harmful content
- Processing of instructions according to allowed operations
- Comprehensive error handling and reporting

## Usage

```python
from preloaded import handle_preloaded_instructions

# Example with dictionary input
instructions = {
    "initialize": {"mode": "development"},
    "configure": {"timeout": 30, "retry": True},
    "load_data": "sample_dataset.csv"
}

result = handle_preloaded_instructions(instructions)
print(result)

# Example with JSON string input
import json
json_instructions = json.dumps({
    "initialize": {"mode": "production"}
})

result = handle_preloaded_instructions(json_instructions)
print(result)

# Example with plain text input
text_instructions = "Load configuration from config.json"
result = handle_preloaded_instructions(text_instructions)
print(result)
```

## Security Considerations

The module is designed to handle preloaded instructions safely by:

1. Validating input to detect injection attempts
2. Sanitizing content to remove potentially harmful code
3. Processing only allowed operations
4. Providing detailed error messages without exposing internal logic

## Testing

Run the included test suite to verify functionality:

```bash
python -m unittest test_preloaded.py
```
