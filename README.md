# Bash Script Generator

This repository contains a bash script that demonstrates how to create a script with comments explaining the verbatim commands that generated it.

## Files

- `generate_script.sh`: The main script that includes comments about how it was generated verbatim
- `test_script.sh`: A test script to verify the functionality of generate_script.sh
- `make_executable.sh`: A utility script to make the other scripts executable

## Usage

1. Make the scripts executable:
   ```
   bash make_executable.sh
   ```

2. Run the test script:
   ```
   ./test_script.sh
   ```

3. Use the generate_script.sh directly:
   ```
   ./generate_script.sh --help
   ./generate_script.sh --count <filename>
   ./generate_script.sh --verbose <filename>
   ```

## How It Works

The `generate_script.sh` file demonstrates how to create a bash script that includes comments explaining the verbatim commands that generated it. The script uses a heredoc approach to show how it was created.

The top of the script contains comments that show the exact commands that would be used to generate such a script, including the heredoc syntax and the chmod command to make it executable.
