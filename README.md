# Response Chain Documentation

This repository contains a shell script that demonstrates and documents the backend services and APIs involved in generating a response to a user query.

## Files

- `trace_response_chain.sh`: The main shell script that simulates and documents the response generation chain
- `test_trace_response_chain.sh`: A unit test script to verify the functionality of the main script

## Usage

Before running the scripts, make them executable:

```bash
chmod +x trace_response_chain.sh test_trace_response_chain.sh
```

### Running the Main Script

To execute the main script and see the response chain in action:

```bash
./trace_response_chain.sh
```

This will:
1. Simulate calls to various backend services
2. Generate a response to a sample query
3. Create a log file (`response_chain.log`) with detailed information about the process

### Running the Tests

To verify that the script works correctly:

```bash
./test_trace_response_chain.sh
```

This will:
1. Check if the main script is executable
2. Run the main script
3. Verify that it produces the expected output
4. Check that all services are properly documented
5. Generate a test log (`test_results.log`) with the results

## Backend Services Documented

The script documents the following backend services and APIs involved in the response chain:

1. **Authentication Service**: Validates user credentials and generates access tokens
2. **User Context Service**: Retrieves user preferences, history, and contextual information
3. **Natural Language Understanding (NLU) Service**: Processes user queries to extract intent and entities
4. **Knowledge Graph Service**: Retrieves relevant information based on identified entities
5. **Weather API** (External): Provides weather forecast data
6. **Response Generation Service**: Creates natural language responses based on collected data
7. **Personalization Service**: Customizes responses based on user preferences
8. **Analytics Service**: Logs interaction data for system improvement

Each service is thoroughly documented in the script with:
- Purpose
- Input/Output specifications
- Technology used
- Dependencies

## Example Output

The script generates a response to a weather query ("What's the weather forecast for tomorrow in New York?") and shows how different services contribute to the final response:

```
Tomorrow in New York, expect partly cloudy conditions with temperatures between 62째F and 78째F (17째C to 26째C). 
There's a 20% chance of rain with light winds from the northwest. Don't forget your umbrella just in case!
```

The log file contains a complete trace of the response generation process, including calls to each service and the data exchanged between them.
