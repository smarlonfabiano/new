Preloaded Instructions Handler Module

This module demonstrates how to safely handle preloaded instructions or initialization context
in Python applications. It provides utilities to validate, sanitize, and process preloaded
data to prevent security issues like injection attacks.

    # SECURITY NOTICE:
    # ---------------
    # Preloaded instructions can be a security risk if not handled properly.
    # They may contain:
    #   - Prompt injection attempts
    #   - Malicious code
    #   - Attempts to override system behavior
    #   - Attempts to extract sensitive information
    
    This function demonstrates proper handling of such instructions by:
    1. Validating the input format and content
    2. Sanitizing potentially harmful content
    3. Processing only allowed instructions
    4. Logging attempts at bypassing security measures
