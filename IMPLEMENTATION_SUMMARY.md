# Implementation Summary

## Overview

I've implemented a simple issue tracking system that satisfies the requirement to "list all issues". The system allows users to add, list, and update issues through a command-line interface.

## Components

1. `issue_tracker` - The main Python script that provides functionality to add, list, and update issues.
2. `test_issue_tracker.py` - Unit tests for the issue tracker.
3. `list_all_issues` - A simple wrapper script that specifically addresses the requirement to "list all issues".
4. `add_sample_issues.py` - A script to add sample issues for demonstration purposes.
5. `README.md` - Documentation for the issue tracker.

## Setup Instructions

1. Make the scripts executable:
   ```bash
   chmod +x issue_tracker
   chmod +x list_all_issues
   ```

2. Add some sample issues:
   ```bash
   python3 add_sample_issues.py
   ```

3. List all issues:
   ```bash
   ./list_all_issues
   ```
   or
   ```bash
   ./issue_tracker list
   ```

4. Run the unit tests:
   ```bash
   python3 test_issue_tracker.py
   ```

## Implementation Details

- Issues are stored in a JSON file (`issues.json`) in the same directory as the script.
- Each issue has an ID, title, description, status, and creation timestamp.
- The system supports filtering issues by status.
- The implementation includes comprehensive unit tests to ensure functionality.

## Addressing the Requirement

The requirement to "list all issues" is addressed in two ways:

1. The `list_all_issues` script, which is a simple wrapper that runs `./issue_tracker list`.
2. The `issue_tracker list` command, which lists all issues in the system.

Both methods display all issues with their ID, title, and status.
